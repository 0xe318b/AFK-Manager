# AFK-Manager


**Description:** *This Discord bot is designed to help users manage their online status within a Discord server. When a user is "AFK" (away from keyboard), they can use the bot to set themselves as afk and provide a reason for their absence. When other users mention the afk user in a message, the bot will automatically send a message indicating that the user is afk and may not be able to respond to the message. When the afk user returns and sends a message, the bot will automatically update their status to "online" and notify others that they are no longer afk. The bot uses a MongoDB database to track and update user status.*
